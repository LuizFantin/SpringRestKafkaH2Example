# SPRING REST KAFKA H2 EXAMPLE

This project implements a backend system based on the [PicPay Backend Technical Challenge](https://github.com/PicPay/picpay-desafio-backend) using **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, **Spring Web (REST)**, and **H2 Database**. Kafka is used for sending notifications asynchronously, ensuring efficient message processing across services.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend application.
- **Kafka**: Real-time messaging system for sending notifications asynchronously.
- **Spring Web (REST)**: Provides RESTful APIs.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for fast, lightweight data storage during development and testing.

## Setup

1 - Run the docker compose command in the project folder:
```bash
  docker-compose up
```

2 - Run the Java Spring Boot project in your favorite IDE.
